Detection of the propargyl radical at lambda 3 mm;The propargyl radical (C?H?) is a key intermediate in combustion chemistry and astrochemistry, playing a critical role in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot in flames, as well as in the synthesis of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium. Despite its significance, the detection of C?H? in various environments remains challenging due to its high reactivity and transient nature. This study reports the successful detection of the propargyl radical at ? 3 mm (100 GHz) using high-resolution rotational spectroscopy. The measurements were conducted in a supersonic jet expansion coupled with a discharge source, enabling the production and stabilization of C?H? under controlled conditions. Rotational transitions were observed and assigned using a combination of ab initio calculations and spectral predictions, with fine and hyperfine structure resolved for the first time at this wavelength. The observed spectra exhibit excellent agreement with theoretical models, confirming the identity of the carrier and providing precise rotational constants, as well as spin-rotation and spin-spin coupling parameters. The detection at ? 3 mm is particularly significant for astrophysical observations, as this wavelength range is accessible to ground-based radio telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The results presented here provide a robust framework for future searches for C?H? in interstellar clouds, circumstellar envelopes, and combustion systems. Additionally, the spectroscopic parameters derived from this work will aid in the interpretation of laboratory and observational data, facilitating a deeper understanding of the chemical pathways involving the propargyl radical. This study underscores the importance of high-resolution spectroscopy in elucidating the structure and reactivity of transient species critical to both terrestrial and extraterrestrial chemistry.;1;DeepSeek-V3;270;"Title: Detection of the propargyl radical at lambda 3 mm

Estimating and Improving Dynamic Treatment Regimes With a Time-Varying Instrumental Variable;Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are sequences of decision rules that guide treatment assignments based on evolving patient histories, offering personalized therapeutic strategies in clinical settings. However, estimating optimal DTRs from observational data is complicated by time-varying confounding, which introduces bias in causal effect estimation. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating and improving DTRs using a time-varying instrumental variable (IV) to address unmeasured confounding. We develop a robust estimation method that leverages the exogenous variation provided by the IV to identify causal effects while adjusting for observed confounders. Our approach extends existing IV techniques to longitudinal settings, enabling consistent estimation of treatment effects even in the presence of unobserved time-dependent confounders. Theoretical results establish the identifiability conditions and asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators. Simulation studies demonstrate the methods effectiveness in recovering optimal treatment rules compared to conventional approaches that ignore unmeasured confounding. We apply our framework to electronic health record data from patients with chronic conditions, illustrating its practical utility in refining treatment strategies. The results highlight the importance of accounting for time-varying unmeasured confounders in DTR estimation and demonstrate how IV methods can enhance the validity of causal inferences in longitudinal studies. This work advances the methodological toolkit for precision medicine, providing a principled approach to optimizing dynamic treatment decisions in real-world settings.;1;DeepSeek-V3;216;"Title: Estimating and Improving Dynamic Treatment Regimes With a Time-Varying Instrumental Variable

We analyze the non-Gaussian statistics of vorticity fluctuations and energy dissipation, revealing anomalous scaling behavior influenced by Ekman friction. The results demonstrate that friction modifies the inertial-range dynamics, producing intermittency exponents distinct from classical 2D turbulence.

From Voids to Coma: the prevalence of pre-processing in the local Universe;The role of pre-processingthe transformation of galaxies in group environments prior to their infall into clustersremains a critical yet poorly constrained aspect of large-scale structure evolution. This study investigates the prevalence of pre-processing across diverse environments in the local Universe, from voids to the Coma cluster, using a multi-wavelength sample of galaxy groups and clusters. We analyze optical and X-ray data to trace star formation quenching, morphological transformations, and gas stripping mechanisms as functions of local density and cluster-centric distance. Our results reveal a strong environmental dependence, with satellite galaxies in group halos exhibiting significantly higher quenching rates than isolated field galaxies, even at comparable stellar masses. We identify a characteristic halo mass scale (~10^13 M?) where pre-processing effects become dominant, demonstrating that a substantial fraction of cluster galaxies are pre-quenched before reaching the cluster environment. The radial distribution of quenched galaxies in Coma suggests that ~40% of its current population underwent pre-processing in group environments. Furthermore, we find that pre-processing efficiency varies with large-scale cosmic web location, with filament-fed clusters showing enhanced pre-processing signatures compared to isotropic accretion. These findings imply that galaxy evolution models must account for the hierarchical nature of environment effects, as the cluster-centric paradigm alone cannot fully explain observed quenching patterns. Our results provide new constraints for semi-analytic models and highlight the importance of group-scale processes in shaping the present-day galaxy population.;1;DeepSeek-V3;229;"Title: From Voids to Coma: the prevalence of pre-processing in the local Universe

Analysis of Modulated Multivariate Oscillations;This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing modulated multivariate oscillations in complex systems, where time-varying amplitude and frequency interactions across multiple channels are of interest. We develop a multivariate extension of the demodulation transform, enabling joint estimation of oscillatory components and their modulation profiles while preserving phase relationships. The method employs a robust optimization approach to separate intrinsic mode dynamics from cross-channel coupling effects. Theoretical analysis establishes identifiability conditions and statistical consistency under noise corruption. Numerical simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to existing univariate techniques, particularly in recovering interaction patterns between modulated oscillators. Applied to high-density EEG recordings during cognitive tasks, the method reveals previously unresolved cross-frequency coupling dynamics that correlate with behavioral performance. The proposed approach provides a principled tool for investigating non-stationary, interdependent oscillations in neural, physical, and engineered systems where multivariate modulation structure carries critical information.;1;DeepSeek-V3;140;"Title: Analysis of Modulated Multivariate Oscillations

Constraints on a scalar-tensor model with Gauss-Bonnet coupling from SN Ia and BAO observations;We investigate observational constraints on a scalar-tensor gravity model featuring a Gauss-Bonnet coupling, using recent Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon+) and baryon acoustic oscillation (DESI Year 1) datasets. By deriving modified Friedmann equations and implementing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we obtain stringent limits on the coupling parameter ? and scalar field potential. Our results show |?| ? 10^2 at 95% confidence level, significantly improving upon previous constraints. The analysis reveals tension between the model's predictions and observed late-time acceleration when requiring consistency with early-Universe physics. These findings suggest that while Gauss-Bonnet coupled scalar-tensor theories remain viable alternatives to ?CDM, their parameter space is substantially constrained by current cosmological observations. The methodology demonstrates how combining geometric probes can effectively test modified gravity scenarios.;1;DeepSeek-V3;123;"Title: Constraints on a scalar-tensor model with Gauss-Bonnet coupling from SN Ia and BAO observations

Anomalous Lattice Behavior of Vanadium Pentaoxide (V2O5): X- Ray Diffraction, Inelastic Neutron Scattering and ab-initio Lattice Dynamics;This study investigates the anomalous lattice dynamics of vanadium pentaoxide (V?O?) through a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Using high-resolution X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering, we reveal unexpected temperature-dependent structural distortions and phonon mode softening near 200 K, indicative of a hidden lattice instability. First-principles density functional theory calculations reproduce these anomalies and trace their origin to strongly anharmonic V-O vibrations coupled to electronic correlations. The computed phonon dispersion exhibits anomalous features along the b*-axis, including a Kohn anomaly at q ? (0, 0.3, 0) that matches observed neutron scattering intensities. We identify a cooperative mechanism involving charge fluctuations between V?? and V?? states that drives the lattice instability, explaining both the temperature-dependent phonon renormalization and the observed deviation from harmonic behavior. The results demonstrate how strongly correlated electron-phonon interactions in this prototypical transition metal oxide lead to complex anharmonic effects beyond conventional quasi-harmonic approximations. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between electronic correlations and lattice dynamics in functional oxides, with implications for understanding their thermal and electronic transport properties.;1;DeepSeek-V3;173;"Title: Anomalous Lattice Behavior of Vanadium Pentaoxide (V2O5): X- Ray Diffraction, Inelastic Neutron Scattering and ab-initio Lattice Dynamics

Semantics-Guided Clustering with Deep Progressive Learning for Semi-Supervised Person Re-identification;This paper presents a novel semantics-guided clustering framework with deep progressive learning for semi-supervised person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach integrates multi-granular semantic cues with an adaptive clustering mechanism to exploit both labeled and unlabeled data effectively. The framework progressively refines pseudo-labels through iterative clustering while maintaining semantic consistency across camera views. We introduce a hybrid contrastive loss that simultaneously optimizes feature discriminability and cluster compactness, bridging the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7%, 81.2%, and 58.6% mAP respectively with only 30% labeled data, outperforming state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods by 3.2-6.8%. The progressive learning strategy shows particular effectiveness in handling large intra-class variations and cross-view misalignments. Ablation studies verify the complementary benefits of semantic guidance and adaptive clustering, while visualization analyses reveal improved feature space organization. This work provides a robust solution for practical Re-ID scenarios where annotation costs are prohibitive, establishing new benchmarks for semi-supervised person retrieval.;1;DeepSeek-V3;160;"Title: Semantics-Guided Clustering with Deep Progressive Learning for Semi-Supervised Person Re-identification

Flow induced ultrasound scattering: experimental studies;This paper presents systematic experimental investigations of ultrasound scattering phenomena induced by fluid flow in both laminar and turbulent regimes. Using a precisely controlled flow loop apparatus with adjustable Reynolds numbers (100 ? Re ? 20,000), we characterize the scattering patterns of 1-10 MHz ultrasound waves under varying flow conditions. High-frequency transducers and advanced signal processing techniques enable quantitative analysis of the Doppler spectra and scattering cross-sections. Our results demonstrate three distinct scattering regimes: (1) a low-Re regime where scattering predominantly arises from viscosity-induced perturbations, (2) an intermediate regime dominated by flow separation effects, and (3) a high-Re turbulent regime where scattering correlates strongly with Kolmogorov-scale vortices. The angular dependence of scattering intensity reveals anisotropic patterns that deviate from classical Born approximation predictions, particularly in transitional flows. Comparative studies with numerical simulations show good agreement for laminar flows but highlight the need for improved turbulence modeling in high-Re conditions. We identify characteristic spectral signatures that enable non-invasive determination of local flow parameters, including velocity gradients and turbulence intensity. The experimental framework provides validation for emerging ultrasound-based flow measurement techniques while revealing fundamental limitations of current scattering theories. These findings have significant implications for industrial flow monitoring, biomedical hemodynamic assessments, and the development of next-generation ultrasonic flow sensors operating in complex fluid environments. The dataset establishes benchmark results for future theoretical developments in flow-acoustics interactions.;1;DeepSeek-V3;224;"Title: Flow induced ultrasound scattering: experimental studies

O2NA: An Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive Approach for Controllable Video Captioning;We present O2NA, a novel object-oriented non-autoregressive framework for controllable video captioning that simultaneously addresses content accuracy and generation efficiency. The proposed architecture decomposes video semantics into object-centric representations through spatio-temporal graph encoding, enabling explicit control over mentioned entities in generated captions. Our non-autoregressive transformer decoder generates all words in parallel while maintaining grammatical coherence through learned positional dependencies, achieving 8.7× faster inference than autoregressive baselines without sacrificing quality. The system incorporates three levels of controllability: object-level grounding through visual attention maps, style modulation via learned embedding vectors, and length-adaptive generation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSVD, MSR-VTT, and VATEX datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with 82.3 CIDEr score on MSVD while supporting real-time generation at 45 FPS. Ablation studies confirm the importance of our object-oriented encoding strategy, which improves mention precision by 12.5% compared to global video representations. Qualitative analysis shows the model's ability to produce diverse descriptions under different control parameters while maintaining factual consistency with visual content.

Supervised Learning of Sparsity-Promoting Regularizers for Denoising;We present a supervised learning framework for automatically designing sparsity-promoting regularizers tailored to specific image denoising tasks. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on handcrafted regularizers or generic sparsity assumptions, our method learns a family of non-convex regularizers directly from training data through a bilevel optimization scheme. The upper level minimizes the mean squared error of denoised images, while the lower level solves the corresponding regularized inverse problem using a proximal algorithm. Our learned regularizers adaptively promote sparsity in learned transform domains while preserving image structures, outperforming both total variation and wavelet-based methods by 1.22.8 dB in PSNR across various noise levels. The framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a parametrized non-convex regularizer architecture enforcing Lipschitz continuity, (2) an efficient unrolling-based optimization that backpropagates through the denoising operator, and (3) a noise-adaptive conditioning mechanism for robust performance across input SNR levels. Extensive experiments on natural, medical, and remote sensing images demonstrate universal improvement over analytic regularizers, with particular advantages in texture preservation and artifact suppression. The learned regularizers show remarkable generalization capability, maintaining performance when applied to unseen noise distributions and image classes. This work establishes a new paradigm for data-driven regularizer design that combines the interpretability of model-based methods with the adaptability of learning-based approaches, bridging an important gap in variational image reconstruction.;1;DeepSeek-V3;214;"Title: Supervised Learning of Sparsity-Promoting Regularizers for Denoising

Vacuum Persistence and Inversion of Spin Statistics in Strong QED;We demonstrate a fundamental connection between vacuum persistence amplitude and spin-statistics inversion in strong-field QED. Through non-perturbative calculations in ultra-intense electromagnetic backgrounds (? ? 1), we show that the effective action acquires anomalous imaginary contributions violating the spin-statistics theorem. This manifests as fermion pair production rates exceeding bosonic counterparts by orders of magnitude at critical field strengths, with the crossover occurring at ? ? 175. The effect originates from non-trivial vacuum polarization structure in strong fields, where the conventional spin-1/2 and spin-0 statistics become inverted. Our results suggest new observable signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity in extreme astrophysical environments and future high-intensity laser experiments.;1;DeepSeek-V3;104;"Title: Vacuum Persistence and Inversion of Spin Statistics in Strong QED

Selection constraints on high redshift quasar searches in the VISTA kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey;This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of selection constraints affecting high-redshift (z > 6.5) quasar identification in the VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey. Through systematic simulations incorporating the survey's photometric depth, bandpass coverage, and selection criteria, we quantify the completeness and contamination rates for quasar detection across the 1500 deg? footprint. Our analysis reveals that while the combination of ZYJHKs filters provides robust photometric redshift discrimination, the effective search volume remains strongly limited by (i) stellar contamination at J < 20.2, (ii) confusion with cool dwarfs in color space, and (iii) sensitivity requirements for identifying the characteristic Ly? break. We demonstrate that a hybrid selection combining strict color cuts (Y?J > 0.8, J?K < 1.4) with morphological classification achieves 78% completeness for z ? 7 quasars with M1450 < ?25, while maintaining <15% contamination from stellar interlopers. The study identifies specific fields within the VIKING survey area that optimize the trade-off between depth and areal coverage for high-z quasar searches, particularly where overlapping multi-wavelength data exists. We present a new selection function formalism that accounts for the survey's varying photometric quality and Galactic extinction patterns, enabling precise calculation of discovery probabilities. Applying this framework to existing VIKING data, we predict the recoverable population of z ? 7 quasars to be 1218 objects down to Ks = 19.5, with a steep decline at higher redshifts due to the survey's 5? detection limits. These results provide essential guidance for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns and establish methodology for optimizing quasar searches in next-generation wide-field infrared surveys like Euclid and LSST.;1;DeepSeek-V3;259;"Title: Selection constraints on high redshift quasar searches in the VISTA kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey

Neutral atomic-carbon QSO absorption-line systems at z>1.5: Sample selection, HI content, reddening, and 2175 A extinction feature;We present a systematic study of neutral atomic-carbon (C I) absorption systems at redshifts z > 1.5, selected from a parent sample of 153 intervening quasar absorption systems in archival VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES spectra. Our sample of 28 C I absorbers represents a five-fold increase over previous compilations, enabling the first robust statistical analysis of their physical and chemical properties. The systems exhibit a bimodal distribution in H I content, with log N(H I) spanning 19.221.7 cm??, where 65% show evidence of partial molecular hydrogen (H?) formation. Through Voigt profile decomposition, we identify multiple velocity components tracing distinct physical conditions, with C I excitation temperatures ranging from 1585 K. The sample reveals strong correlations between C I equivalent width and both reddening (E(B-V) = 0.010.25 mag) and the presence of the 2175 ? extinction feature (detected in 43% of systems). Comparative analysis with Galactic and Magellanic Cloud sightlines indicates these absorbers preferentially probe Milky Way-like dust environments rather than SMC-type conditions. We develop a new selection function accounting for line saturation effects and survey completeness, demonstrating that C I systems trace approximately 3% of all damped Lyman-? absorbers (DLAs) at these redshifts. The data show a pronounced deficit of C I systems at z > 3.5, suggesting evolution in carbon enrichment or excitation conditions. Cloudy photoionization modeling indicates these systems require high densities (n_H > 30 cm??) and moderate UV shielding (G_0 < 10) to maintain neutral carbon. The 2175 ? feature carriers show a strong preference for environments with [Zn/Fe] > 0.3, supporting their association with grain-processing shocks. These results establish C I absorbers as unique probes of cold, metal-rich gas in galaxies during peak star formation epochs, providing critical constraints on interstellar medium conditions in the distant universe. Our findings have important implications for interpreting quasar reddening and modeling molecular gas reservoirs in high-redshift galaxies.;1;DeepSeek-V3;310;"Title: Neutral atomic-carbon QSO absorption-line systems at z>1.5: Sample selection, HI content, reddening, and 2175 A extinction feature

Discovery of the Transition of a Mini-Broad Absorption Line into Broad Absorption in the SDSS Quasar J115122.14+020426.3;We report the first unambiguous detection of a mini-broad absorption line (mini-BAL) transforming into a broad absorption line (BAL) in the quasar J115122.14+020426.3 (z = 2.40) using multi-epoch SDSS spectra spanning 20032018. The C IV absorption system exhibited a dramatic increase in velocity width from 1,250 km/s (FWHM) to 4,800 km/s over 5.3 years (rest-frame), accompanied by a factor of 3.5 increase in equivalent width. High-resolution follow-up spectroscopy with Keck/HIRES revealed complex substructure in the developed BAL, showing at least five distinct kinematic components spanning 3,00025,000 km/s. The transition occurred during a period of modest continuum brightening (?V = +0.23 mag), ruling out ionization changes as the dominant mechanism. Our analysis favors a scenario where an existing mini-BAL wind (NH ? 10?? cm??) encountered denser material (NH ? 10?? cm??) in its path, potentially from a disk outflow or interstellar cloud. Photoionization modeling indicates the BAL phase requires higher column densities (log NH > 22) and lower ionization parameters (log U < ?1.5) than the mini-BAL progenitor. The event's timescale constrains the absorber's transverse motion to <0.1 pc/yr, suggesting an origin near the accretion disk (R ? 0.11 pc) rather than galactic scales. This transformation provides direct evidence for the evolutionary connection between mini-BALs and BALs, supporting models where BAL outflows develop from pre-existing, narrower winds. The observed kinematics agree with radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative-inefficient winds transitioning to radiatively-driven outflows. Our findings challenge the traditional BAL/non-BAL dichotomy and suggest a continuum of quasar outflow phenomena dependent on temporal sampling. This discovery opens new avenues for studying quasar wind dynamics through multi-epoch spectroscopy of transitioning systems.;1;DeepSeek-V3;268;"Title: Discovery of the Transition of a Mini-Broad Absorption Line into Broad Absorption in the SDSS Quasar J115122.14+020426.3

The transition between these regimes occurs abruptly at r ? 600 pc, coincident with a region of enhanced velocity dispersion (?_v > 50 km/s). Our data show clear evidence of gas inflow along the minor axis, with streaming motions of 3060 km/s transporting gas inward at a rate of 0.8 M?/yr. The nuclear gas disk exhibits non-circular motions consistent with a warped structure, likely induced by the ongoing angular momentum cancellation between the counter-rotating components. We identify six molecular cloud complexes within the central 300 pc, with masses (28)×10? M? and sizes <50 pc, potentially fueling the low-luminosity AGN. The derived gas-to-dust ratio (120±25) and conversion factor (?_CO = 3.1 M? (K km/s pc?)??) differ significantly between the co- and counter-rotating components, indicating distinct chemical histories. These observations provide the most detailed view to date of gas dynamics in a counter-rotating system, demonstrating how such configurations can drive efficient gas transport to galactic centers. The results support scenarios where counter-rotation arises from later gas accretion rather than major mergers, with important implications for understanding fueling mechanisms in LINER galaxies.;1;DeepSeek-V3;267;"Title: Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) I.The counter-rotating LINER NGC4826

Discovery of the black hole X-ray binary transient MAXIJ1348-630;We report the discovery of the X-ray binary transient MAXI J1348-630, detected during its 2019 outburst by the MAXI Gas Slit Camera and subsequently monitored by Swift, NICER, and NuSTAR. The source reached a peak luminosity of 1.2×10?? erg s?? (220 keV) and exhibited spectral state transitions characteristic of black hole binaries, including a prominent low-hard to high-soft state transition at 3% of the Eddington luminosity. Radio observations with ATCA revealed spatially resolved jet ejecta moving at 0.4c, coinciding with the state transition. The 0.579 keV spectrum during the soft state is well-described by a multi-temperature disk (kT_max = 1.1 keV) plus thermal Comptonization component (? = 2.3), with evidence for a broad Fe K? line (EW = 150 eV). Timing analysis revealed type-C quasi-periodic oscillations between 0.16 Hz that followed standard frequency-luminosity relations. We constrain the system parameters through optical spectroscopy with SALT, identifying a K-type donor star and deriving a distance of 2.2±0.3 kpc from interstellar absorption features. The outburst lightcurve shows three distinct reflares with 1520 day recurrence times, suggesting unusual disk instability behavior. Our analysis of the 4.5 day eclipse period yields a black hole mass estimate of 8.1±1.2 M? and an inclination of 72°±3°. The source's position near the Galactic plane (l = 309.°3, b = +1.°4) and low quiescent luminosity (<10?? erg s??) explain its previous nondetection. MAXI J1348-630 represents one of the closest known Galactic black hole transients and provides a rare example of a system exhibiting both jet ejections and disk eclipses, making it an important laboratory for studying accretion physics. The comprehensive multiwavelength dataset presented here offers unique insights into the connection between accretion states and jet formation in stellar-mass black holes.;1;DeepSeek-V3;285;"Title: Discovery of the black hole X-ray binary transient MAXIJ1348-630

Holographic power-law traps for the efficient production of Bose-Einstein condensates;We demonstrate a holographic optical trapping technique for creating power-law potential landscapes that enable efficient production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Using phase-engineered laser beams, we generate tunable potentials of the form V(r) ? r^? (0.5 ? ? ? 3.5) with diffraction-limited precision. This method achieves 85% transfer efficiency from a magneto-optical trap to a ? = 2.3 potential, reaching condensation thresholds 3.2× faster than conventional harmonic traps. The power-law exponent ? is optimized to balance evaporative cooling efficiency against trap depth requirements, reducing the total evaporation time by 42% compared to hybrid magnetic-optical approaches. This versatile trapping scheme enables rapid BEC production with minimal experimental overhead, particularly beneficial for quantum sensing applications requiring high repetition rates.;1;DeepSeek-V3;116;"Title: Holographic power-law traps for the efficient production of Bose-Einstein condensates

BCCNet: Bayesian classifier combination neural network;We present BCCNet, a novel Bayesian classifier combination framework that integrates neural network flexibility with principled uncertainty quantification. The architecture learns to optimally combine predictions from multiple base classifiers by modeling their correlations and individual reliabilities through a trainable Bayesian network layer. Our approach jointly optimizes both the combination weights and base classifier outputs in an end-to-end differentiable manner, while maintaining interpretability through explicit uncertainty estimates. The model employs a variational inference scheme that scales to large ensembles, avoiding the computational limitations of exact Bayesian methods. On benchmark datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet), BCCNet achieves 3.2-5.7% higher accuracy compared to conventional ensemble methods, with particularly strong performance gains (up to 8.1%) in low-data regimes. The learned combination weights automatically adapt to input characteristics, reducing reliance on underperforming classifiers for ambiguous samples. Experimental results demonstrate robust calibration, with expected confidence intervals containing the true class 94.3% of the time (vs. 82.1% for naive averaging). The framework naturally handles missing classifiers and provides theoretically-grounded confidence estimates without requiring post-hoc calibration. BCCNet establishes a new paradigm for classifier combination that bridges the gap between neural network performance and Bayesian reliability, particularly valuable for safety-critical applications requiring trustworthy uncertainty quantification.;1;DeepSeek-V3;194;"Title: BCCNet: Bayesian classifier combination neural network

A Theory of Concepts and Their Combinations II: A Hilbert Space Representation;This paper develops a Hilbert space representation for the theory of concepts and their combinations introduced in Part I. We construct a quantum-inspired framework where concepts correspond to vectors in a complex Hilbert space, and combination operations are modeled through tensor products and linear operators. The model naturally captures contextuality and emergent properties in concept combinations through quantum superposition and entanglement analogs. Measurement operators represent specific contextual instantiations, while unitary transformations model conceptual state evolution. We prove representation theorems showing how this framework generalizes classical prototype and exemplar theories while accommodating well-documented cognitive phenomena like the conjunction fallacy. The Hilbert space formalism provides both a mathematically rigorous foundation for modeling concept dynamics and new tools for analyzing empirical data on conceptual combinations.;1;DeepSeek-V3;122;"Title: A Theory of Concepts and Their Combinations II: A Hilbert Space Representation

Hubble imaging of the ionizing radiation from a star-forming galaxy at z=3.2 with fesc>50%;We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of Q1549-C25, a Lyman continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at z=3.2 with an unprecedented escape fraction fesc>50%. Utilizing deep WFC3/UVIS F336W observations, we resolve the ionizing radiation morphology, revealing three compact star-forming regions (r<200 pc) contributing 82±7% of the total LyC flux. The LyC emission shows no spatial offset (>0.3 kpc) from the non-ionizing UV continuum, ruling out significant contributions from faint AGN or foreground interlopers. Spectroscopic follow-up with Keck/DEIMOS confirms the systemic redshift and shows a blueshifted [OIII]5007 component (?v=?320 km/s), indicating strong gas outflows. The galaxy exhibits extreme emission line ratios ([OIII]/[OII]=8.2±0.9) and high ionization parameter (log U=?2.1), consistent with density-bounded HII regions. Our population synthesis modeling indicates a young stellar population (3 Myr) with a top-heavy IMF (?=?1.9) contributes >60% of the ionizing photons. The HST data reveal an anisotropic escape geometry, with LyC emission primarily emerging through low-column-density channels (NHI<1017 cm?2) between star-forming clumps. Compared to stacked non-LyC emitters at similar redshift, Q1549-C25 shows 2.5× higher [OIII] equivalent width and 0.5 mag bluer UV slope, suggesting distinct stellar populations drive the high fesc. The galaxy resides in an underdense environment (?<?0.6), implying local feedback processes rather than external triggers dominate the LyC escape. These observations provide the first resolved view of extreme ionizing radiation escape at high redshift, offering critical constraints for models of cosmic reionization. The results demonstrate that rare galaxies with special geometries and stellar populations could have played disproportionate roles in driving reionization.;1;DeepSeek-V3;245;"Title: Hubble imaging of the ionizing radiation from a star-forming galaxy at z=3.2 with fesc>50%

Charge occupancy of two interacting electrons on artificial molecules - exact results;We present exact analytical solutions for the charge occupancy of two interacting electrons confined in coupled quantum dot systems (artificial molecules). Using a Hubbard-type model with both intra- and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive closed-form expressions for the occupation probabilities as functions of detuning energy and tunnel coupling. The solutions reveal three distinct regimes: (i) a delocalized state with balanced occupations at weak interactions (U < ?), (ii) a correlated state with occupation inversion at intermediate couplings (? ? U), and (iii) a fully localized state at strong interactions (U > 2?). The exact results demonstrate how electron-electron repulsion modifies the molecular orbital structure, leading to non-monotonic occupation behavior that cannot be captured by mean-field approximations. Our calculations predict a characteristic crossover voltage (V_c ? U/e) where the double occupancy probability drops sharply, providing a direct experimental signature of electronic correlations. The model is extended to include asymmetric couplings and finite temperatures, showing how thermal fluctuations smear the quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. These results establish fundamental limits for charge control in artificial molecular systems and provide benchmark solutions for testing numerical approaches to correlated electron dynamics in nanoscale devices.;1;DeepSeek-V3;193;"Title: Charge occupancy of two interacting electrons on artificial molecules - exact results

Multiple crossing of Landau levels of two-dimensional fermions in double HgTe quantum wells;We report experimental observation of multiple Landau level crossings in two-dimensional fermion systems realized in double HgTe quantum wells. Magnetotransport measurements reveal a sequence of three distinct crossings in the N=0 and N=1 Landau levels at magnetic fields of 2.1 T, 3.8 T, and 5.4 T, evidenced by avoided crossings in the energy spectrum with minimum gaps of 0.7 meV. The crossing pattern arises from the interplay between quantum confinement-induced band inversion and Zeeman splitting, demonstrating tunable topological phase transitions in this system.

Less than perfect quantum wavefunctions in momentum-space: How phi(p) senses disturbances in the force;We investigate how momentum-space wavefunctions ?(p) encode information about spatial disturbances in the potential. Through analytical and numerical analysis of model systems with localized perturbations, we demonstrate that ?(p) exhibits characteristic oscillatory patterns when the potential's Fourier components introduce momentum correlations. These disturbances manifest as (i) interference fringes with spacing ?p ? ?/? (where ? is the perturbation length scale) and (ii) power-law tails ?p?n (with n = 24) sensitive to potential discontinuities. The results establish ?(p) as a sensitive probe of force-field irregularities, providing a complementary approach to coordinate-space analysis for diagnosing quantum systems with imperfect potentials.;1;DeepSeek-V3;99;"Title: Less than perfect quantum wavefunctions in momentum-space: How phi(p) senses disturbances in the force

Quantifying Surveillance in the Networked Age: Node-based Intrusions and Group Privacy;"This paper develops a comprehensive framework for quantifying surveillance in networked systems by introducing novel metrics for node-based intrusions and group privacy violations. We present a graph-theoretic model that captures both targeted monitoring (node-centric attacks) and emergent privacy risks arising from network topology (group inference attacks). Our analysis reveals three fundamental dimensions of surveillance intensity: (1) *node observability* (quantified through eigenvector centrality-weighted exposure scores), (2) *group identifiability* (modeled via k-anonymity violations in community structures), and (3) *correlation vulnerability* (measuring information leakage through clustering coefficients). The framework incorporates both active surveillance strategies (adversary-controlled node penetrations) and passive data collection scenarios (metadata analysis). Using synthetic and empirical networks (including Facebook interaction graphs and telecommunications datasets), we demonstrate that even low surveillance coverage (510% node penetration) can compromise 6075% of group privacy when combined with community detection algorithms. We derive exact solutions for Erdõs-Rényi networks and approximation methods for scale-free networks showing that surveillance efficacy follows a phase transition at the critical penetration ratio pc ? (ln N)/N. The model further quantifies how homophily increases group vulnerability by 3050% compared to random networks. A case study of contact tracing networks reveals that conventional privacy protections fail to prevent 80% of group inference attacks when as few as 3% of nodes report exact trajectories. Our results establish mathematical limits on ""surveillance efficiency""  proving that no polynomial-time algorithm can optimally allocate surveillance resources while preserving group privacy above theoretical thresholds. These findings provide policymakers with quantitative tools to evaluate surveillance architectures and highlight the need for new privacy paradigms that address network-level vulnerabilities beyond individual data protection. The framework advances the theoretical foundations of digital privacy by bridging algorithmic surveillance analysis with social network science.";1;DeepSeek-V3;283;"Title: Quantifying Surveillance in the Networked Age: Node-based Intrusions and Group Privacy

First Views of a Nearby LIRG: Star Formation and Molecular Gas in IRAS 04296+2923;We present the first high-resolution study of the nearby luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) IRAS 04296+2923 (D=78 Mpc), combining ALMA Band 6/7 observations (0.?3 resolution) with Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 imaging. The CO(2-1) and [CI](1-0) maps reveal a compact molecular disk (r_e=1.2 kpc) containing 3.1×10^9 M? of H_2 gas, with a central concentration (?_H2=650 M? pc^-2) fueling a starburst of 18 M? yr^-1. The gas kinematics show strong non-circular motions (?v=120 km s^-1) consistent with a barred potential, confirmed by our stellar mass map showing a prominent bar (a/b=2.4, L_bar=3.8 kpc). The star formation efficiency varies radially, peaking at 3× the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation in the nuclear region where we resolve 37 supergiant molecular clouds (M_avg=7×10^6 M?). The [CI]/CO ratio increases outward from 0.08 to 0.22, indicating a metallicity gradient from Z=1.1 to 0.5 Z?. HST imaging reveals a complex dust morphology with 9 massive young clusters (M_*>10^5 M?) forming along the bar, their ages (3-7 Myr) matching the gas depletion timescale. We identify three distinct star-forming modes: (1) nuclear starburst (?_dep=35 Myr), (2) bar-driven spiral arms (?_dep=120 Myr), and (3) an outer ring with diffuse emission (?_dep=1.2 Gyr). The gas-to-dust ratio varies from 80 in the nucleus to 220 in the outskirts, suggesting differential dust destruction. Compared to high-z LIRGs, IRAS 04296 shows similar ?_SFR but 5× higher ?_H2, indicating less efficient feedback. These results provide a template for resolved studies of LIRG physics, demonstrating how bar-driven processes can sustain extreme star formation without major mergers.

Detection of the propargyl radical at lambda 3 mm;"We report the detection of the propargyl radical (C$_3$H$_3$) in the laboratory at ? 3 mm, utilizing a supersonic expansion coupled with a high-sensitivity microwave spectrometer. This study focuses on the rotational transitions within the ground electronic and vibrational states of this crucial hydrocarbon species. Propargyl, a radical implicated in combustion processes and interstellar chemistry, presents a complex rotational spectrum due to its open-shell nature and near-symmetric top structure. The experimental setup employed a pulsed discharge through a precursor mixture of allene (C$_3$H$_4$) or propargyl chloride (C$_3$H$_3$Cl) diluted in argon, generating a rotationally cold molecular beam. The microwave spectrum was recorded using frequency modulation spectroscopy, enabling the precise determination of transition frequencies and line intensities. The observed spectral lines were assigned to the propargyl radical based on characteristic rotational constants and hyperfine splitting patterns. A comprehensive analysis of the rotational spectrum yielded accurate spectroscopic parameters, including rotational constants A, B, and C, centrifugal distortion constants, and hyperfine coupling constants arising from the interaction of the unpaired electron with the nuclear spins of the hydrogen atoms. The determined rotational constants are consistent with previous theoretical calculations and infrared spectroscopic studies, validating the assignment. The hyperfine structure, resolved for several rotational transitions, provided valuable insights into the electronic spin distribution within the radical. The high signal-to-noise ratio achieved in this study facilitated the detection of weak transitions, contributing to a more complete characterization of the propargyl radical's rotational spectrum at ? 3 mm. These precise spectroscopic data are essential for the unambiguous identification and quantification of propargyl in astrophysical environments and combustion flames, where it plays a significant role in the formation of larger hydrocarbons.

Estimating and Improving Dynamic Treatment Regimes With a Time-Varying Instrumental Variable;"This paper addresses the estimation and improvement of dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) in the presence of a time-varying instrumental variable (IV). DTRs, sequences of decision rules that tailor treatments to individual patient characteristics over time, are crucial in chronic disease management. However, the presence of unmeasured confounders can bias the estimation of optimal DTRs. We propose a novel methodology that leverages a time-varying IV to mitigate this bias. Specifically, we extend existing instrumental variable techniques to the dynamic treatment setting, accommodating the temporal dependencies inherent in DTRs. Our approach involves a two-stage estimation procedure: first, we estimate the causal effects of treatments using the time-varying IV; second, we employ these estimates to construct optimal DTRs. We establish the theoretical properties of our estimator, demonstrating its consistency and asymptotic normality under appropriate regularity conditions. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven method for improving existing DTRs by incorporating the information provided by the time-varying IV. Simulation studies and real-world data analyses illustrate the efficacy of our proposed methods, highlighting the potential for improved patient outcomes through the application of time-varying IVs in DTR estimation and optimization.

From Voids to Coma: the prevalence of pre-processing in the local Universe;"We present a comprehensive study investigating the prevalence of galaxy pre-processing in the local Universe, spanning from the low-density environments of voids to the high-density regions of the Coma cluster. Pre-processing, the alteration of galaxy properties within group environments before their accretion into larger clusters, plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution. Utilizing a large sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we employ a multi-faceted approach to quantify the extent of pre-processing. We identify galaxies residing in various environments, from isolated void galaxies to those within groups and clusters, and analyze their morphological, star-forming, and environmental characteristics. We utilize statistical methods, including environmental density measurements and group membership identification, to assess the impact of pre-processing on galaxy properties. We find a significant gradient in pre-processing signatures, with galaxies in lower-density environments exhibiting less evidence of transformation compared to those in denser regions. Specifically, we observe a higher fraction of quenched galaxies and galaxies with disturbed morphologies in groups compared to isolated galaxies, indicating that pre-processing is already active in these intermediate environments. Our analysis reveals that the strength of pre-processing increases with environmental density, culminating in the significant transformations observed in the Coma cluster. This suggests that pre-processing is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the local Universe, influencing galaxy evolution across a wide range of environments. Our findings highlight the importance of considering pre-processing when studying the evolution of galaxy populations in clusters and filaments.

We develop a framework for assessing the time-varying coupling between these oscillatory components, utilizing metrics derived from instantaneous phase differences and amplitude correlations. This approach facilitates the detection of dynamic changes in oscillatory coupling, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms generating the observed oscillations.

Anomalous Lattice Behavior of Vanadium Pentaoxide (V2O5): X- Ray Diffraction, Inelastic Neutron Scattering and ab-initio Lattice Dynamics;"This study investigates the anomalous lattice behavior of vanadium pentaoxide (V$_2$O$_5$) through a combined experimental and theoretical approach. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments, and ab-initio lattice dynamics calculations are employed to elucidate the structural and vibrational properties of this material. XRD analysis reveals an unusual thermal expansion behavior, deviating from standard harmonic models. INS experiments provide detailed information on the phonon dispersion relations and vibrational density of states, revealing anomalies in the low-energy phonon modes. Ab-initio lattice dynamics calculations, based on density functional theory, are performed to compute the phonon spectra and analyze the interatomic force constants. These calculations corroborate the experimental findings, highlighting the presence of strong anharmonicity and structural instabilities. The observed anomalies are attributed to the layered crystal structure and the complex interplay between the vanadium and oxygen atoms. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the anomalous lattice dynamics in V$_2$O$_5$, shedding light on its unique physical properties.

Semantics-Guided Clustering with Deep Progressive Learning for Semi-Supervised Person Re-identification;This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised person re-identification (Re-ID) framework, leveraging semantics-guided clustering with deep progressive learning. We address the challenge of limited labeled data by exploiting semantic information extracted from unlabeled data to guide the clustering process. Specifically, we integrate attribute-based semantic features into a deep clustering architecture, enabling the formation of more discriminative clusters. A deep progressive learning strategy is employed to iteratively refine the cluster assignments and improve the feature representation. This strategy gradually increases the confidence of pseudo-labels assigned to unlabeled data, enabling the network to learn progressively from the enriched information. We introduce a joint optimization objective that combines clustering loss, classification loss, and semantic consistency loss to ensure the learned features are both discriminative and semantically meaningful. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised person Re-ID.;1;Gemini 2.0 Flash;142;"Title: Semantics-Guided Clustering with Deep Progressive Learning for Semi-Supervised Person Re-identification

Flow induced ultrasound scattering: experimental studies;"This paper presents experimental investigations into flow-induced ultrasound scattering, focusing on the characterization of acoustic scattering from turbulent fluid flows. We employ a controlled experimental setup to generate well-defined turbulent flows, enabling precise measurements of ultrasound scattering patterns. The experimental arrangement utilizes a phased array ultrasound transducer to transmit and receive acoustic signals, allowing for spatial mapping of the scattered ultrasound field. We examine the influence of flow parameters, such as Reynolds number and turbulence intensity, on the characteristics of the scattered ultrasound. The acquired data are analyzed to extract information regarding the statistical properties of the turbulent flow, including the velocity fluctuations and turbulence spectra. We observe a direct correlation between the flow's turbulent kinetic energy and the intensity of the scattered ultrasound. Furthermore, we investigate the anisotropic nature of ultrasound scattering in the presence of shear flows, revealing the dependence of scattering patterns on the incident ultrasound angle relative to the flow direction. The experimental results validate theoretical models describing ultrasound scattering from turbulent flows, providing valuable insights into the underlying physical mechanisms. The findings of this study contribute to the advancement of ultrasound-based flow measurement techniques, particularly in applications involving complex fluid dynamics.

O2NA: An Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive Approach for Controllable Video Captioning;"This paper introduces O2NA, an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach for controllable video captioning. We address the inherent limitations of autoregressive models, which suffer from sequential decoding bottlenecks and limited control over caption generation. O2NA leverages an object-centric representation of video content, extracting salient objects and their relationships to facilitate parallel caption generation. We propose a non-autoregressive decoder that directly predicts the entire caption sequence, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Control over the generated captions is achieved through the integration of attribute-based conditioning, allowing for the manipulation of specific object properties and narrative styles.

Supervised Learning of Sparsity-Promoting Regularizers for Denoising;"This paper presents a supervised learning framework for designing sparsity-promoting regularizers tailored for denoising applications. We address the challenge of constructing optimal regularizers by learning them directly from training data, thereby adapting to specific noise characteristics and signal structures. Our approach employs a deep neural network to parameterize the regularizer, enabling the learning of complex, non-linear functions that promote sparsity in the denoised signal representation. The network is trained end-to-end, minimizing a loss function that incorporates both the denoising performance and the sparsity of the solution. We leverage a supervised learning paradigm, utilizing paired noisy and clean signals to guide the learning process. This allows for the optimization of the regularizer specifically for the statistical properties of the noise and the underlying signal distribution. Furthermore, we explore the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge into the network architecture, enhancing the performance and interpretability of the learned regularizer. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, showcasing its ability to learn high-performing sparsity-promoting regularizers that outperform traditional hand-crafted approaches. The learned regularizers exhibit improved denoising performance and achieve enhanced sparsity in the reconstructed signals, demonstrating the advantages of supervised learning in this context.

Selection constraints on high redshift quasar searches in the VISTA kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey;"This study examines the selection constraints inherent in high-redshift quasar searches within the VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey. We investigate the impact of survey selection criteria, including photometric cuts and color-based selection techniques, on the completeness and purity of quasar samples at redshifts z>5. The VIKING survey, with its deep near-infrared observations, offers a significant dataset for identifying these rare objects. However, the identification of high-redshift quasars is complicated by contamination from other astronomical sources, such as cool dwarfs and low-redshift galaxies. We employ a combination of photometric simulations and empirical analyses to characterize the selection function of quasars in the VIKING survey. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of various color-color diagrams and photometric redshift estimates in distinguishing quasars from contaminants. We assess the completeness of quasar samples by comparing the observed number densities to theoretical predictions and known quasar luminosity functions. We quantify the purity of the samples by analyzing the contamination rates from stellar and galactic sources. Furthermore, we explore the influence of dust extinction and photometric scatter on the selection of high-redshift quasars. Our analysis reveals that certain color cuts can effectively select quasar candidates, but they also introduce biases and incompleteness. We provide a detailed characterization of the selection constraints, including the redshift-dependent completeness and purity estimates, which are crucial for accurate statistical studies of high-redshift quasar populations. The results highlight the importance of careful selection criteria and detailed simulations for extracting reliable quasar samples from large-scale infrared surveys like VIKING. This study provides valuable insights for future high-redshift quasar searches and contributes to a better understanding of the early Universe.

Discovery of the Transition of a Mini-Broad Absorption Line into Broad Absorption in the SDSS Quasar J115122.14+020426.3;"We report the discovery of a dynamic transition in the absorption features of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar J115122.14+020426.3, specifically the evolution of a mini-broad absorption line (mini-BAL) into a broad absorption line (BAL). This phenomenon was observed through a comparative analysis of multiple epochs of spectroscopic data, revealing a significant change in the morphology and velocity width of the absorption features associated with outflowing material. We present detailed spectral analyses, including velocity profiles and equivalent width measurements, to characterize the transition. The mini-BAL, initially characterized by its narrow velocity width and moderate absorption strength, exhibited a progressive increase in velocity width and absorption depth over time, eventually evolving into a classical BAL structure. We discuss potential physical mechanisms driving this transition, including variations in the ionization state, density, and velocity of the outflowing gas. We explore the implications of this discovery for understanding the dynamics and evolution of quasar outflows, particularly the launching and acceleration mechanisms of BAL winds. We also consider the potential impact of this transition on the quasar's observed spectral energy distribution and its feedback effects on the host galaxy. The observed transition provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of quasar outflows in real time, offering valuable insights into the complex interplay between active galactic nuclei and their surrounding environments.

The initial detection revealed a significant increase in X-ray flux, indicating the onset of an outburst. Follow-up observations across multiple wavelengths, including optical, infrared, and radio, confirmed the transient nature of the source and its classification as a black hole candidate. We present the temporal and spectral characteristics of the outburst, analyzing the X-ray light curve and spectral evolution. The X-ray light curve exhibits a rapid rise followed by a gradual decay, indicative of a typical black hole X-ray binary outburst.

We estimate the distance to the source using optical and infrared photometry, providing constraints on the system's luminosity. We also examine the radio emission, investigating the presence of relativistic jets and their contribution to the overall energy budget. The spectral and temporal properties, coupled with the observed radio emission, strongly suggest the presence of a black hole in the system.

Hubble imaging of the ionizing radiation from a star-forming galaxy at z=3.2 with fesc>50%;"We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a star-forming galaxy at redshift z=3.2, notable for its exceptionally high Lyman continuum escape fraction (fesc>50%). Utilizing deep ultraviolet imaging, we directly observe the spatial distribution of ionizing radiation emanating from this galaxy. This study aims to characterize the physical mechanisms responsible for the efficient escape of Lyman continuum photons, crucial for understanding the reionization of the early universe. We analyze the morphology of the galaxy in both the Lyman continuum and non-ionizing ultraviolet wavelengths, revealing distinct spatial variations in their emission profiles.

Quantifying Surveillance in the Networked Age: Node-based Intrusions and Group Privacy;"This paper presents a framework for quantifying surveillance in the networked age, focusing on node-based intrusions and their impact on group privacy. We develop a methodology to assess the degree of surveillance exposure by analyzing network topology and information flow, considering both individual node vulnerabilities and the collective privacy implications for interconnected groups. We introduce metrics to quantify the risk of node compromise, incorporating factors such as node centrality, connectivity, and data sensitivity. We further develop a model to evaluate group privacy erosion, considering the propagation of information through the network and the potential for inference attacks. We explore the trade-off between network utility and privacy, examining how different surveillance strategies impact network functionality and information dissemination. We propose a graph-theoretic approach to model the dynamics of information leakage, allowing for the simulation of various surveillance scenarios. Our analysis reveals that seemingly innocuous node compromises can have significant cascading effects, impacting the privacy of entire groups. We identify critical nodes whose compromise leads to disproportionately large privacy breaches, highlighting the importance of targeted security measures. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as differential privacy and anonymization techniques, in mitigating surveillance risks. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies on real-world networks, illustrating the practical implications of our findings. This work provides a foundation for understanding and quantifying surveillance in complex networked environments, contributing to the development of robust privacy-preserving strategies.

Detection of the propargyl radical at lambda 3 mm;The detection of the propargyl radical, a highly reactive intermediate in organic chemistry, is presented as a significant achievement in the field of ultraviolet laser spectroscopy. Utilizing an advanced cryogenic setup and cutting-edge laser technology, our research team successfully observed the presence of this elusive species at a wavelength of 3 mm, providing novel insights into its electronic structure and reactivity.  The propargyl radical (C2H3) is known for its highly reactive nature, making it challenging to study using traditional spectroscopic methods. Our investigation aimed to overcome these limitations by employing a sophisticated laser system capable of generating high-intensity pulses at the millimeter wavelength range. By precisely tuning the resonant frequency of the propargyl radical, we were able to selectively excite and probe its electronic transitions.  The experimental results demonstrate the presence of the propargyl radical at the expected lambda 3 mm transition, with a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 10:1. The observed spectral features are consistent with the predicted energy levels of the radical, providing strong evidence for its detection. Notably, our study reveals the presence of an additional, previously unobserved transition at 2.7 mm, which is assigned to the lowest-lying electronic state.  The implications of this discovery extend beyond the realm of fundamental chemistry research. The detection of the propargyl radical has significant implications for understanding its role in various organic reactions, including cross-coupling and chain transfer processes. Furthermore, the observed spectral features provide valuable insights into the electronic structure and reactivity of this radical, which can be leveraged to design novel synthetic routes and catalytic systems.  In conclusion, our research demonstrates the feasibility of detecting the propargyl radical at lambda 3 mm using advanced laser spectroscopy techniques.

Estimating and Improving Dynamic Treatment Regimes With a Time-Varying Instrumental Variable;Estimating and Improving Dynamic Treatment Regimes With a Time-Varying Instrumental Variable  In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) that can adapt to changing patient characteristics and treatment outcomes over time. However, estimating DTRs is challenging due to the presence of non-stationarity and time-varying instrumental variables (IVs). This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating DTRs using a time-varying IV, which enables us to capture the dynamic relationships between treatment assignment, patient characteristics, and outcomes.  Our method employs a two-step estimation procedure that first identifies a set of optimal IVs and then uses these IVs to estimate the DTR. The proposed method leverages recent advances in machine learning and Bayesian model averaging to handle the non-stationarity and time-varying nature of IVs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using synthetic data and real-world datasets from cancer treatment trials, where we show significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing methods.  The findings of this study have important implications for the development of personalized treatment strategies that can adapt to changing patient needs over time. Our method provides a valuable framework for researchers and practitioners to estimate DTRs with a time-varying IV, which can lead to improved treatment outcomes and better decision-making in healthcare settings.;1;llama3.2;209;"Title: Estimating and Improving Dynamic Treatment Regimes With a Time-Varying Instrumental Variable

From Voids to Coma: the prevalence of pre-processing in the local Universe;"The Local Universe is characterized by vast expanses of empty space, commonly referred to as voids, which are thought to be the result of ongoing galaxy formation and evolution. However, recent observations have led us to question whether these voids may be a manifestation of an even more fundamental process: pre-processing. In this study, we investigate the prevalence of pre-processing in the local Universe, with a focus on its role in shaping the distribution of galaxies within voids.  Using a combination of hydrodynamic simulations and observational data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that pre-processing is indeed a ubiquitous feature of galaxy distributions in the local Universe. We demonstrate that pre-processing can be responsible for the observed clustering of galaxies within voids, as well as the creation of ""galaxy walls""  networks of galaxy filaments that are thought to be formed through the merger of smaller structures.  Our results suggest that pre-processing plays a critical role in regulating the formation and distribution of galaxies within voids. We also find that pre-processing is not unique to our local Universe, but is instead a general feature of the cosmic web on large scales. By understanding the mechanisms underlying pre-processing, we gain insights into the complex interplay between matter, energy, and gravity that governs the evolution of the universe.  Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of pre-processing in the context of the cosmic web, which is a fundamental framework for understanding galaxy distributions, galaxy clusters, and large-scale structure. By exploring the prevalence of pre-processing in the local Universe, we shed new light on the intricate processes that shape the fabric of space itself.";1;llama3.2;271;"Title: From Voids to Coma: the prevalence of pre-processing in the local Universe

Analysis of Modulated Multivariate Oscillations;This study presents an in-depth examination of modulated multivariate oscillations (MMOs), a phenomenon characterized by the synchronized fluctuations of multiple variables across distinct frequency bands. We employ a multi-scale analysis approach, integrating techniques from time-frequency analysis and machine learning to elucidate the underlying dynamics driving MMOs. Our results reveal that MMOs are ubiquitously present in various complex systems, including physiological, social, and financial networks. The multivariate oscillations exhibited by these systems often exhibit adaptive properties, adjusting to changing environmental conditions and exhibiting emergent behaviors that transcend individual component interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phase-locking values of MMOs can serve as a valuable proxy for system resilience, predicting potential failures and vulnerabilities in complex systems. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between multivariate oscillations and the dynamics of complex systems, offering new avenues for predictive modeling and risk assessment in various fields.;1;llama3.2;147;"Title: Analysis of Modulated Multivariate Oscillations

Constraints on a scalar-tensor model with Gauss-Bonnet coupling from SN Ia and BAO observations;We constrain a scalar-tensor model with Gauss-Bonnet coupling using a combination of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) observations and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The modified gravity model includes a scalar field, which couples to the Ricci scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet term. We implement this model into the public codebase of the cosmological parameter estimation package, MontePython, and perform a Bayesian inference of the model parameters using SN Ia and BAO data from BOSS. Our results indicate that the model can be ruled out by both datasets, with no evidence for an alternative to the standard ?CDM paradigm. The scalar-tensor model is therefore ruled out as a viable extension of our current understanding of dark energy.;1;llama3.2;123;"Title: Constraints on a scalar-tensor model with Gauss-Bonnet coupling from SN Ia and BAO observations

Anomalous Lattice Behavior of Vanadium Pentaoxide (V2O5): X- Ray Diffraction, Inelastic Neutron Scattering and ab-initio Lattice Dynamics;Title: Anomalous Lattice Behavior of Vanadium Pentaoxide (V2O5): A Multimodal Approach to Understanding its Unique Properties  Vanadium pentaoxide (V2O5), a well-known vanadate compound, exhibits an intriguing and unusual lattice behavior that is not fully understood. This study employs a multimodal approach combining X-ray diffraction (XRD), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and ab-initio lattice dynamics to elucidate the anomalous behavior of V2O5's crystal structure. The results of these experiments reveal that V2O5 exhibits a non-orthorhombic lattice, characterized by an unprecedented arrangement of vanadium and oxygen atoms.  Using XRD, we observed a complex diffraction pattern indicative of multiple structural phases in equilibrium, which cannot be explained by traditional crystalline models. INS measurements further confirmed the presence of these phases, providing insight into the atomic-scale dynamics of V2O5's lattice vibrations. In contrast, ab-initio lattice dynamics simulations reveal an unusually high density of states at low temperatures, suggesting a dynamic and disordered nature of the vanadate layers.  Our findings significantly challenge current understanding of V2O5's crystal structure and properties, highlighting the need for re-evaluation of its electronic and thermal behavior. This study paves the way for further research into the anomalous lattice behavior of V2O5 and its potential applications in various fields.;1;llama3.2;;"Title: Anomalous Lattice Behavior of Vanadium Pentaoxide (V2O5): X- Ray Diffraction, Inelastic Neutron Scattering and ab-initio Lattice Dynamics

Semantics-Guided Clustering with Deep Progressive Learning for Semi-Supervised Person Re-identification;"This paper presents a novel approach to person re-identification (Re-ID) by integrating semantics-guided clustering with deep progressive learning techniques for semi-supervised scenarios. In traditional Re-ID methods, a large amount of labeled data is required to establish accurate mapping between images and identities. However, such datasets are often scarce or difficult to obtain, particularly in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that leverages the power of deep learning and clustering algorithms to adaptively construct a semi-supervised dataset from limited annotations.  Our approach consists of two primary components: (1) semantics-guided clustering, which incorporates contextual information into cluster formation, ensuring more meaningful groupings; and (2) deep progressive learning, which iteratively refines the clustering results through multiple stages of learning. By jointly optimizing these two components, our framework achieves improved performance in person Re-ID tasks while reducing the need for extensive labeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets with relatively small annotated sets. Our method paves the way for efficient and accurate semi-supervised person Re-ID solutions, which can be applied to various applications such as surveillance systems and smart security cameras.";1;llama3.2;192;"Title: Semantics-Guided Clustering with Deep Progressive Learning for Semi-Supervised Person Re-identification

Flow induced ultrasound scattering: experimental studies;Flow-induced ultrasound scattering refers to the phenomenon where the interaction between fluid dynamics and acoustic waves generates scattered signals that are significantly affected by the flow environment. This area of research seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms and correlations between flow parameters, such as velocity and turbulence intensity, and the resulting scattered signals.  In recent years, advances in high-speed imaging techniques have enabled researchers to capture dynamic flow patterns with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. These advancements have led to a surge in experimental studies focusing on the effects of flow-induced ultrasound scattering. By examining the interactions between fluid flows and acoustic waves, scientists can gain insights into the underlying physical processes governing this phenomenon.  This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding flow-induced ultrasound scattering, with an emphasis on recent experimental findings. We will focus on the key findings from various studies, highlighting the relationships between flow parameters and scattered signals. By exploring these correlations, researchers can develop more accurate models for predicting the behavior of fluid flows in complex environments.  Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of this research for real-world applications, such as non-destructive testing, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring. The understanding of flow-induced ultrasound scattering has the potential to revolutionize these fields by providing novel diagnostic tools and improved performance metrics.;1;llama3.2;218;"Title: Flow induced ultrasound scattering: experimental studies

O2NA: An Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive Approach for Controllable Video Captioning;This paper presents O2NA, an innovative approach to controllable video captioning that leverages object-oriented principles to enhance non-autoregressive models. Traditional autoregressive architectures rely on complex sequential dependencies between frames, limiting their ability to capture nuanced temporal relationships and contextual information. In contrast, our method employs a novel hybrid framework that integrates both autoregressive and attention-based mechanisms. By incorporating an object-oriented schema, O2NA enables the model to selectively focus on specific objects or regions of interest within the video, thereby improving caption coherence and accuracy.  Our approach is grounded in the principles of object-oriented programming, where objects are defined as self-contained entities with inherent properties and behaviors. In the context of video captioning, this translates to modeling video frames as objects with distinct attributes, such as object category, location, and motion patterns. The hybrid model combines an autoregressive encoder to capture sequential dependencies with a multi-head attention decoder that selectively attends to relevant objects. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of O2NA in achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while outperforming established baselines.;1;llama3.2;172;"Title: O2NA: An Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive Approach for Controllable Video Captioning

Supervised Learning of Sparsity-Promoting Regularizers for Denoising;"We present a novel approach to supervised learning of sparsity-promoting regularizers for denoising, tackling the challenge of incorporating prior knowledge into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve their robustness against noise and missing data. Our framework leverages a multi-task learning strategy, where a CNN is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously: denoising, inpainting, and image compression. The sparsity-promoting regularizer is learned jointly with the CNN architecture through a self-supervised process that encourages sparse representations of the input data.  The proposed method, dubbed ""Sparse-Denoise"", enables CNNs to adaptively learn effective prior knowledge from the training data, allowing them to effectively remove noise and generate coherent patches in inpainted images. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several benchmark datasets, including the ImageNet dataset with added Gaussian noise and the COCO dataset with missing regions.  Our results show that Sparse-Denoise outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM) and qualitative evaluations (e.g., visual inspection). We achieve significant gains over baseline CNNs without regularizers, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating prior knowledge into the learning process. The proposed method also exhibits robustness to varying levels of noise and missing data, making it suitable for real-world applications where data quality is often compromised.";1;llama3.2;203;"Title: Supervised Learning of Sparsity-Promoting Regularizers for Denoising

Selection constraints on high redshift quasar searches in the VISTA kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey;The detection of high-redshift quasars is crucial for understanding the early universe's evolution, star formation rates, and metal enrichment. The VISTA (Visually Impacted Sky Telescopes Array) kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey offers an unparalleled opportunity to identify luminous quasars at z > 2. This study presents a systematic analysis of selection constraints in identifying high-redshift quasars from the first data release of the VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations (VDSO).   We applied a multi-wavelength approach, utilizing the 4.1-m telescope's infrared imaging capabilities, supplemented by optical and near-infrared observations. Our sample comprises a robust set of candidates at z > 2, selected based on their infrared luminosity and photometric properties. To validate our selection criteria, we employed various Bayesian inference techniques to assess the probability of quasar detection for each candidate.   Our results demonstrate that the VISTA kilo-degree survey is an effective platform for high-redshift quasar discovery. By employing a combination of multiband observations and sophisticated selection algorithms, we have successfully identified a robust set of candidates at z > 2. We discuss the implications of our findings on current understanding of quasar evolution and star formation rates in the early universe. Furthermore, we outline potential avenues for further investigation into the properties of these distant luminous objects.  Our analysis highlights the significance of multi-wavelength surveys in probing high-redshift galaxies, providing unprecedented insights into the origins of supermassive black holes and galaxy growth. We conclude that the VISTA kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey offers a valuable resource for quasar research, offering an unparalleled opportunity to explore the early universe's most luminous objects.;1;llama3.2;257;"Title: Selection constraints on high redshift quasar searches in the VISTA kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey

Neutral atomic-carbon QSO absorption-line systems at z>1.5: Sample selection, HI content, reddening, and 2175 A extinction feature;We present an analysis of neutral atomic-carbon QSO absorption-line systems observed at redshifts greater than 1.5, highlighting their unique properties and implications for our understanding of intergalactic medium (IGM) composition and structure. By selecting a sample of 20 quasar-absorption line systems from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), we demonstrate the utility of this observational approach for probing the IGM at high redshifts.  Our study reveals that neutral atomic-carbon (HI) content in these QSO absorption-line systems is consistent with predictions from simulations, suggesting that HI is indeed a dominant component of the IGM at z > 1.5. However, we also observe significant variations in the HI column densities, which may be attributed to the complex interplay between gas accretion, outflow activity, and galaxy mergers.  Redshifted Lyman-? forest lines show signs of reddening, indicative of dust extinction in the QSO's host galaxy or surrounding IGM. We investigate this phenomenon using the 2175 ? extinction feature as a diagnostic tool, finding that it is consistently present in our sample but often with lower column densities than expected from simple dust models. This discrepancy may be due to the presence of complex dust structures or alternative dust species.  Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of QSO absorption-line systems for probing the IGM at high redshifts and highlights the need for more nuanced dust models to explain observed reddening patterns. Furthermore, our results provide new insights into the evolution of gas content and structure in the IGM over cosmic time scales. By exploiting the unique properties of neutral atomic-carbon QSO absorption-line systems, we aim to improve our understanding of the intergalactic medium's role in shaping galaxy evolution and large-scale structure formation.;1;llama3.2;285;"Title: Neutral atomic-carbon QSO absorption-line systems at z>1.5: Sample selection, HI content, reddening, and 2175 A extinction feature

Discovery of the Transition of a Mini-Broad Absorption Line into Broad Absorption in the SDSS Quasar J115122.14+020426.3;We report the detection of a significant transition in the mini-broad absorption line (MBAL) of SDSS J115122.14+020426.3, a z=2.44 quasar observed through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope. The original MBAL was first identified by [Author's Name et al., 2020] and was characterized by an equivalent width of approximately 0.5 ?. However, during our follow-up spectroscopic observations with the Keck Observatory, we noticed a subtle but definitive broadening of the absorption line profile.  The transition in the MBAL is attributed to the presence of a companion star or another source of ionizing radiation that has been previously obscured by intervening gas. Our analysis suggests that the broadening of the absorption line is caused by the expansion of the outflow driven by the quasar's accretion disk. This event marks an important milestone in the study of MBALs, as it provides evidence for the complex and dynamic nature of quasar outflows.  The observed transition has significant implications for our understanding of the interplay between quasars and their environments. It highlights the importance of monitoring MBALs over time to detect subtle changes that can reveal new insights into quasar evolution. Moreover, this discovery underscores the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms driving quasar outflows, including the role of companions and other sources of radiation. The detection of this transition in SDSS J115122.14+020426.3 provides a unique opportunity to explore these topics further, offering new avenues for research and potentially shedding light on the most intriguing questions surrounding quasars and their environments.;1;llama3.2;251;"Title: Discovery of the Transition of a Mini-Broad Absorption Line into Broad Absorption in the SDSS Quasar J115122.14+020426.3

Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) I.The counter-rotating LINER NGC4826;The nuclear region of NGC4826, a luminous Infrared Emitting Region (LIR) galaxy, harbors a complex and intriguing phenomenon - counter-rotating molecular gas. This study presents the first-ever detailed observation of this unique feature using high angular resolution observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our data reveal that the counter-rotating gas is dynamically confined within a toroidal-shaped structure, spanning approximately 3 arcminutes, situated at the nucleus. The counter-rotation is not merely a local phenomenon but appears to be a galaxy-wide feature, with similar kinematics observed in the vicinity of the central black hole.  The observational evidence for the counter-rotating gas is presented through detailed maps of CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) line emission, which demonstrate a strikingly asymmetric distribution of molecular material. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the gas exhibits a wide range of velocities, from -200 to +300 km/s, with a peculiar lack of stars at the nucleus, suggesting a significant impact on star formation. The observed kinematic properties are found to be inconsistent with the simple expectations of dynamical friction or gravitational torques alone.  Instead, our results point towards an intricate interplay between the counter-rotating gas and the central black hole's accretion flow. We propose that the galaxy's unique counter-rotation may arise from a close encounter with another galaxy in the distant past, leading to the formation of this novel toroidal structure as a result of gravitational perturbations. Further investigation is necessary to unravel the physics behind this fascinating phenomenon and its connection to the galaxy's evolution, star formation processes, and black hole activity. This study contributes significantly to our understanding of galactic evolution and highlights the importance of ALMA in probing the intricate details of nuclear environments.;1;llama3.2;278;"Title: Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) I.The counter-rotating LINER NGC4826

Discovery of the black hole X-ray binary transient MAXIJ1348-630;We report the discovery of MAXIJ1348-630, a transient black hole X-ray binary system detected through its association with an extreme mass transfer event in the globular cluster NGC 6309-6245. The X-ray source exhibited a unique characteristic transient behavior, transitioning from high accretion rates to complete quenching over a span of approximately 4 days, accompanied by negligible optical variability and distinct modulation patterns in its spectral characteristics.  Our observations revealed that MAXIJ1348-630 is not the primary X-ray emitter during the initial stages of the event but instead serves as a companion star undergoing intense mass transfer from an accreting compact object. The system's properties suggest the presence of a massive, stellar-mass black hole with a mass range consistent with the theoretical predictions for the most extreme population of compact objects in globular clusters.  We utilized the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Swift Telescope to obtain extensive X-ray data and monitored the optical flux of the candidate companion star over an extended period. The results provide conclusive evidence that MAXIJ1348-630 is indeed a black hole companion undergoing significant mass transfer from an accreting compact object, and we demonstrate that this phenomenon can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying stellar-mass black holes in globular clusters.  Further studies are necessary to constrain the exact nature of the transiting X-ray source and determine its precise properties. However, our findings highlight the critical role of transient X-ray variability in the search for compact objects in crowded environments such as globular clusters. By exploring this phenomenon further, we can refine our understanding of the diverse population of compact objects and shed light on their role in shaping the evolution of these ancient stellar systems.;1;llama3.2;279;"Title: Discovery of the black hole X-ray binary transient MAXIJ1348-630

Hubble imaging of the ionizing radiation from a star-forming galaxy at z=3.2 with fesc>50%;We present the first high-resolution observations of the ionizing radiation from a massive, star-forming galaxy at a redshift of 3.2. This galaxy, selected for its exceptionally high fraction of dust extinction (fesc > 50%), was observed using the Hubble Space Telescope's advanced spectrographic capabilities. Our data reveal an intricate network of ionized gas filaments, spanning tens of kiloparsecs in length, which emanate from the galaxy's central regions. These filaments are thought to be driven by powerful outflows of hot, ionized gas, which interact with and modify the surrounding intergalactic medium.  Our observations demonstrate that these outflows play a critical role in regulating star formation within the galaxy, effectively truncating the growth of massive stars at high redshifts. The unique properties of this galaxy's environment also provide insights into the early universe's star-formation processes, offering a glimpse into the epoch preceding the first galaxies' assembly. By studying the ionizing radiation from such distant systems, we can gain valuable understanding of the interplay between stellar and supermassive black hole activity, shedding light on the complex interactions driving galaxy evolution over cosmic timescales.  Furthermore, our findings provide crucial evidence for the ongoing growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts. By observing the spectral signatures of these black holes in distant galaxies, we can better constrain models of their evolution and assess the impact of mergers on their masses.

Quantifying Surveillance in the Networked Age: Node-based Intrusions and Group Privacy;The proliferation of networked technologies has given rise to unprecedented surveillance opportunities, posing significant concerns for individual privacy and group security. This paper explores the concept of node-based intrusions, where malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in networked infrastructures to compromise sensitive information. By employing a novel framework that integrates social network analysis and graph theory, we quantify the impact of node-based intrusions on group privacy.  Our investigation reveals that compromised nodes can serve as conduits for widespread surveillance, allowing attackers to collect and exploit sensitive information about individuals within a group. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the interconnectedness of nodes can facilitate the dissemination of personal data across multiple platforms, exacerbating the risks associated with node-based intrusions.  Through extensive simulations and case studies, we identify key factors that contribute to the vulnerability of groups to node-based intrusions, including social network structure, node centrality, and information sharing patterns. We also develop novel metrics for evaluating the efficacy of countermeasures aimed at protecting group privacy in the face of node-based intrusions.  Our research highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of node-based intrusions and their implications for group security. By providing actionable insights into the vulnerabilities of networked infrastructures, we offer a foundation for the development of effective strategies to mitigate these threats. Our results demonstrate that a concerted effort is required from governments, corporations, and individuals to address the growing concern of node-based intrusions and protect individual privacy in the networked age.  Ultimately, our research underscores the importance of adopting proactive measures to safeguard group privacy in the face of evolving surveillance threats. By acknowledging the interconnectedness of nodes and leveraging advances in social network analysis and graph theory, we can develop more resilient and secure networked infrastructures that prioritize individual privacy and group security.;1;llama3.2;293;"Title: Quantifying Surveillance in the Networked Age: Node-based Intrusions and Group Privacy

First Views of a Nearby LIRG: Star Formation and Molecular Gas in IRAS 04296+2923;We present the first deep observations of the Local Interstellar Medium Regulation Galaxy (LIRG) IRAS 04296+2923, utilizing a combination of state-of-the-art multi-wavelength observations. This galaxy, located at a distance of approximately 200 million parsecs, is situated in the direction of the constellation Andromeda and is thought to be one of the closest LIRGs to our local Milky Way galaxy.  The data presented here consists of high-resolution radio-synthesis imaging from the Very Large Array (VLA) and mid-infrared spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations reveal a complex interplay between star formation, gas depletion, and outflow activity in IRAS 04296+2923. The VLA data display striking features of an active galactic nucleus (AGN)-induced starburst ring surrounding the galaxy's central core. Meanwhile, mid-infrared spectroscopy reveals a diverse array of molecular lines that suggest a significant amount of gas being depleted from the system.  Our analysis suggests that IRAS 04296+2923 is experiencing an episode of intense star formation driven by an AGN. The observed radio and infrared emission are likely indicative of an ongoing burst of nuclear activity, accompanied by strong winds and outflows. Furthermore, we identify a population of high-redshift stars with enhanced metallic enrichment, providing valuable insights into the galaxy's early chemical evolution.  The study of LIRGs like IRAS 04296+2923 is essential for understanding the mechanisms regulating star formation in local galaxies. The data presented here provide a comprehensive view of this particular LIRG and contribute to our broader understanding of the complex interplay between gas dynamics, star formation, and galaxy evolution. Our findings will have significant implications for ongoing research on galaxy evolution, star formation, and the role of AGN in regulating the growth of galaxies.;1;llama3.2;275;"Title: First Views of a Nearby LIRG: Star Formation and Molecular Gas in IRAS 04296+2923
